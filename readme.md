## Summary of the E-commerce

In this project we had to simulate a E-commerce, implementing all the knowledge that we have received in different technologies, for example: Node, express, mysql, sequelize, etc. The database used was MySql, a realtional database so we need to stablish relationships between the entities that we have created.
In my case, I´ve done the E-commerce of a soccer shop in which I can do many things, for example: the creation of users, products, categories. The login and logout of users, etc.

## All the endpoints created

<ul>
    <li>
    Products: Users can manage products through specific endpoints, including creation, update, and deletion. There are search functionalities, price sorting, and authentication requirements.
    </li>
    <li>
    Categories: Category management, including creation, updating, and deletion, is possible via specific endpoints. Categories can be associated with products.
    </li>
    <li>
    Orders: Users can place orders, and there's an endpoint to view orders along with their associated products.
    </li>
    <li>
    Users: User management includes creation and login with secure password handling (bcrypt and JWT). Users can view their orders and products.
    </li>
    <li>
    Seeders: Five products were created using seeders to populate the database.
    </li>
    <li>
    Admin Role: An admin role allows for product creation, updating, and deletion, granting specific privileges for administrative tasks.
    </li>
</ul>
